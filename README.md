# React training

## Building a react SPA by little steps, enhancing the project in the process.

I've beginning this project with the main goal of use react for a personal need.

I am runner, and web developer, so I wanted to try something similar to my favourite web training application (adidas's micoach).

For this I have captured the micoach api json response and save this in a json file (data.json) (by now).
And use as a project base, a facebook react totorial, and a lot of posts.
I consider this as ones of the last knowledge source that help me a lot:

https://css-tricks.com/learning-react-router/
But it is know for all of us, that the facebook's learning material is amazing (its react github pages, redux, its videos on youtube.).

So I will be going throw different steps in my project ( I hope this), keep each big step in a branch,
and the last one merged onto master:

## Steps
1. Startup
..* Read a lot of react posts, trying to keep sane. (almost done)
..* Copy a project and adapt it for my running training app. done
..* The app and it api is served with express. done
..* The app show a list of chronologically sorted trainings. done
..* The app highlights the nearest next training. done
..* The app center the training lists in the nearest next training. bug
